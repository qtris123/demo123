### Vim and Nano Customization

From Lecture 2, you should have learned about how Vim enables commands by typing colon ":" followed by your command. However, there are some commands you don't want to have to type every time. For example, it's pretty normal to want line numbers whenever you open a file. But having to type `:set number` every time you run Vim kinda sucks. How can we avoid this?

Your `~/.vimrc` (Vim Run Control) file controls what commands will run every time Vim is invoked. You can customize it to your heart's content.

You can disable this at any time within a file by typing `:set nonumber` within Vim, or by deleting it from your `~/.vimrc` and then re-opening Vim again.

As you can imagine, there are thousands of commands you can leverage in your `~/.vimrc` file. For a great resource on customization, read [this article](https://docs.j7k6.org/my-minimal-vimrc/). 

A favorite quote from that article that you should definitely adhere to is:

>"Don't put any lines in your vimrc that you don't understand."

For those who are using nano, here is an article about [nano customization](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.1/nanorc.5.html). Similar to Vim, you add your commands in your `~/.nanorc` file.
